# React + Vite

This is my first project for dev mountain, for my project I created a tool for creating a pokemon team, you can add a pokemon and set its name, image, health, and moveset, you can also delete, and edit pokemon in your roster. The application stops adding pokemon when u click add once there is 6 pokemon on your team.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
